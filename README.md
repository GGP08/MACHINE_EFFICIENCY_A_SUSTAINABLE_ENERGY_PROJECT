Machine Efficiency: A Sustainable Energy Project

This project explores machine efficiency and predictive maintenance using real-world data. The goal is to analyze machine performance metrics, detect patterns, and build AI/ML solutions that contribute to sustainable energy practices.

üå± Internship Theme

This project is part of the Green Skills Internship program, focusing on AI/ML applications for sustainable energy and efficient machine utilization.

‚úÖ Week 1: Dataset Selection & Exploration

Selected a Predictive Maintenance Dataset from Kaggle.

Performed initial Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Checked missing values and data types.

Analyzed class imbalance.

Visualized feature distributions (temperature, torque, rotational speed).

Created a heatmap showing feature correlations.

‚úÖ Week 2: Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering

Applied label encoding for categorical variables.

Scaled numerical features using StandardScaler.

Handled class imbalance using SMOTE technique.

Selected important features for model training.

‚úÖ Week 3: Model Development & Evaluation

Built baseline machine learning models:

Logistic Regression

Random Forest Classifier

Evaluated models using accuracy, ROC-AUC, confusion matrix, and classification report.

Selected Random Forest as the final model for better performance.

Implemented energy savings estimation based on failure prediction and immediate repair.

‚úÖ Week 4: Model Saving & Deployment Preparation

Saved trained model, scaler, and label encoder using Joblib.

Prepared the solution for deployment to provide real-time machine failure prediction and energy saving insights.
