# Machine Efficiency: A Sustainable Energy Project  

This project explores machine efficiency and predictive maintenance using real-world data. The goal is to analyze machine performance metrics, detect patterns, and build AI/ML solutions that contribute to sustainable energy practices.  

---

## 🔍 Week 1: Dataset Selection & Exploration
- Selected a **Predictive Maintenance Dataset** from Kaggle.  
- Performed initial **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
  - Checked missing values, data types, and class imbalance.  
  - Visualized distributions (temperature, torque, rotational speed).  
  - Created a heatmap for feature correlations.  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Jupyter Notebook  
- **Tools:** PyCharm, Jupyter Notebook, GitHub  

---

## 🌱 Internship Theme
This project is part of the **Green Skills Internship** program, focusing on AI/ML applications for **sustainable energy** and efficient machine utilization.

---

## 🚀 Next Steps
- Week 2: Deeper EDA & feature engineering.  
- Week 3: Build baseline ML models.  
- Week 4: Create a deployment-ready application.
